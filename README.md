Part 1
This app will give a running directory of the top win % champions picked by pro players, their runes/masteries and their/the enemy's teamcomp. It will be a quick and easy directory for people to click on a champion's icon and see what pros have high winrates on champions and what they did to get there. 
Part 2
Op.gg scraper -
A user can enter their op.gg ID into the app to get a comparison of their builds to pro players', and get recommendations on what to play and what pro they play like. Free opgg reviews with small generic tips/item comparisons. Ex: "You have a 55% winrate with Xayah and build IE first. doublelift (link to his profile) has a 75% winrate with xayah and builds ER RFC IE. Keep playing xayah, but maybe change your build."
